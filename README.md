## About This Repository

## Development Workflow

We use a branching strategy to safely test new code before deploying to production:

1. **Main Branch** - Production-ready code that is deployed live
2. 2. **Develop Branch** - Development/staging branch where new features are tested
   3. 3. **Feature Branches** - Individual feature branches for specific changes
     
      4. ## How to Contribute
     
      5. 1. Create a feature branch from `develop`
         2. 2. Make your changes
            3. 3. Submit a Pull Request
               4. 4. Wait for review and approval
                  5. 5. Once approved, your changes will be merged to `develop`
                     6. 6. When ready, `develop` will be merged to `main` for production
